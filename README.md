# PinballMaker
Final project for iOS class

This was a interesting project becuase I had originally pitched a much more intensely feature driven project that would be built on SpriteKit and using other existing 
Apple frameworks. I was told I needed to pivot and use OpenGL ES and implment all functionality from scratch and lose most of my features. 
I wasn't very proud of what it looked like or how it performed at times, but am very proud of how much I learned while building it. 


I hope to rebuild this and use Apples supporting frameworks in the future.
